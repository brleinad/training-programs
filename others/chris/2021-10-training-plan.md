## Mobility Warm up (10 to 15 minutes)

Use this warm up for all of the sessions:
* Finger flicks
* Ankle and knee rotations
* hip rotations
* shoulder dislocated and rotations
* scapular shrugs

## Antagonists
* push ups: 3 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 reps with excellent form.
* external shoulder rotations: 2 or 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps.
* forearm extensors: 2 or 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps with whatever weight feels good going slow.
* knee mobility excercise 


# Bouldering day (1.5 hours)

First fo the mobility warm up then pick one of the two climbing warm ups.

## Option A Climbing warm up:

* 2/3 sets of 2-8 minute ARC
    - easy climbing with 6 out of 10 pump and no rests on the wall
    - rest 2 to 5 minutes per set
    - focus on technique: silent feet and moving with good flow
    - if it feels hard for a warm up or technique deteriorates just reduce set duration and/or intensity.

## Option B CLimbing warm up:

* 2 to 4 V0/V1s in a row with no rest in between
* rest for 3 to 4 minute
* 1 to 3 V2/V3s with 1 minute rest in between
* rest for 5 minutes
* 1 V4 that's the same style as one of your projects
* Optional: rest for 5 to 10 minutes and do another V4


## Limit Bouldering AKA projecting:

* Project 1 V6/V7  for at least 15 mintues but no more than 25 minutes with at least 3 minute rests. 
* Repeat for another V6/V7 of a different style

- For solid attemps rest for 10 minutes
- If you don't feel fully recruited to start projecting then finish warming up the fingers by hanging on different positions of the projects without moving.



# Lead day 

Start with the mobility warm up

## ARCing
* 2 sets of 10 minute reps of 5.7 to 5.9 climbing on the auto-belay with 5 to 10 minute rests.
Focus on good technique and resting as little as possible on the wall, try to be constantly moving. Think about keeping straight arms, silent feet, constant flow and constant breathing.
You should NOT be getting too pumped, if it hurts then the climbing is too hard so go down a grade or two.
